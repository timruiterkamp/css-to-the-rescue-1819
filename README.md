## What I learned

The things I learned during this week was mostly trying out new fun stuff. In the end I focused on things like clip-path, clip-path animations, text manipulations and perspective scroll effects.

I had never used postcss, in this project I tried it out for it's nesting functionality which, for me, was a must in combination with BEM to avoid duplication of code.
