# CSS to the Rescue @cmda-minor-web 18-19

This subject was all about trying out cool stuff. So I did just that. I tried to experiment with effects, polygons, animations and perspective to create a something fun and unordinary.

## What I learned

The things I learned during this week was mostly trying out new fun stuff. In the end I focused on things like clip-path, clip-path animations, text manipulations and perspective scroll effects.

I had never used postcss, in this project I tried it out for it's nesting functionality which, for me, was a must in combination with BEM to avoid duplication of code.

## Challenges

- Dark/light mode for the magazine (I solved this based on the time, from 18:00 till 07:00 dark mode will be active)
- Weather based design (I used the weather api to use the visibility and wind outside for the visibility of my site)
- No squares, no rectangles, no circles, no triangles
- BEM (I used BEM to make my styling and html setup)
