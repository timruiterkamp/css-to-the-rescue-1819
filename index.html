            Marijn is a software engineer. He can only use his left hand, and
            with that hand he has difficulty with fine motor control. This means
            typing can be hard for him. It’s even one of the reasons why he
            didn’t finish university. He had to write papers. Marijn is
            incredibly intelligent, so thinking up a paper is very easy. Yet
            typing it would take him ages.
          </p>

          <p class="introduction__content">
            Basically the problem he has with keyboard layouts is that not all
            keys are next to each other.

              Typing the word <em>is</em> is much harder though. He will have to

          <p class="introduction__content">
            After observing Marijn using his computer, Rick Buter, a student of
            mine, explored alternative ways of typing words. What if, Rick

            At first Rick didn’t dare to mention his idea, let alone create a
            working prototype. When he first thought of it, it simply seemed too
            ridiculous. Only when I explicitly asked my students to come up with

            Allowing ideas that seem nonsensical into a design proces can lead
            to innovative products. This is a common ideation method used in

            My personal interest in nonsense has grown while I was working at a
            large web design agency. Everything we did there had to make sense,
            by which I mean that everything had to have an easily measurable
            effect. More visitors, more money, better performance, simple things
            like that. And thus we only investigated the obvious. This always
            gave me the feeling that we were missing out on things.
          </p>

          <p class="thoughts__content">
            Back in 2010, as a reaction to this professional focus on
            <em>utility</em> I started a website called
            <a href="https://lovenonsense.com/" class="thoughts__link"
              >Love Nonsense</a
            >, in which I blogged about nonsensical, mostly funny but often
            insightful topics. I have worked on several nonsensical side
            projects as well. Like this
            <a>script that translates colour code into written language.</a

                At first this idea of making colour accessible to blind people
                seemed nonsensical to me, since I assumed blind people can’t see
                colour. Later it turned out that some blind people can see colour,
                and others may have memory of it, like I explained in the section

                Just like the six-key-typing project by Rick Buter, this is an
                example of using nonsense in order to allow weird ideas, and
                exploring them. And in these cases they resulted in valuable new
                insights.

              <p class="thoughts__content">
                Apart from a simple ideation tool to allow weird ideas, there are
                other reasons to use nonsense as well. Other reasons are lifting
                ideas beyond the obvious, breaking out of a single rusty context,
                exploring the unexpected, and of course having fun.

            An example of using nonsense to lift ideas beyond the obvious is
            this prototype of a talking dog. During my master research I
            organised a few Exclusive Design Challenges. Some of the more
            interesting ideas grew out of the <em>add nonsense</em> principle.
            Like this idea of smart glasses that give a blind person some
            information about the surroundings. This is a quite common idea, and
            <a class="talkingdogs__link">working implementations of this already exists.</a

            This team took this obvious idea to a next level by

              ><sup>5</sup></a
            >
            All of a sudden all kinds of new possibilities and questions emerge.
            What’s the personality of the dog? Will the dog be able to tell
            persons who want to pet it that you really shouldn’t? Will it crack
            jokes? How will people react when they are being described by a
            talking dog? It would be so interesting, and so much fun, to explore
            this idea further.

          <p class="talkingdogs__content">
            At another one of these workshops one of the teams had a lot of fun,
            together with Marijn, with working on an idea of using Marijn’s
            complete electric wheelchair as a device to control a website. They
            envisioned Marijn moving the mouse cursor by driving through a large
            room, filled with sensors. While possibly spectacular, this of
            course is a rather unpractical idea. Yet it did contribute to my
            <a class="talkingdogs__link">simple spatial navigation experiment,</a

            which can be seen as a more economical and more practical version of
            this wheelchair mouse. This is a nice example of just having fun,
            which is important as well when working with a serious subject like
            accessibility.

            A nice example of breaking out of a single, rusty context by
            allowing nonsense is the project I did with Simon Dogger. He asked
            me to create
            <a class="talkingdogs__link">an accessible version of the 2doc website</a

              ><sup>7</sup></a
            >
            for him, a website with video documentaries. This may be dismissed
            as nonsensical: why would a blind person want to watch
            documentaries. Yet in many ways of course it does make sense: A
            video documentary is not only visual, there’s a lot of auditory
            information in documentaries as well. And of course, apart from the
            documentary itself there’s a lot of extra information about the
            documentary as well, like the description and meta information
            that’s of interest to Simon’s research as a designer.
          </p>

          <p class="talkingdogs__content">
            It reminds me of a discussion I had with Katrien Vermeulen, my wife,
            a long time ago when I still worked at this web design agency. Back
            then we were working on checkout flows for webshops, and our sole
            focus was on making it as easy and as frictionless as possible for
            people to buy stuff. Making it harder to buy things sounded like
            utter nonsense to me. Until I discussed this with Katrien who works
            with homeless people and people with severe, chronic debt issues.
            She convincingly argued that there are very good reasons to make it
            harder instead of easier to buy things.
          </p>

          <p class="talkingdogs__content">
            Both these examples, the one of making videos accessible to blind
            people, and the one about making webshop checkout flows harder to
            use are good examples of not dismissing arguments that sound
            nonsensical without giving them serious thought. Allowing this kind
            of nonsense into our research can broaden our vision and can result
            in completely different products.

          <h3 class="talkingdogs__title" id="invisibleanimations">Invisible animations</h3>

          <p class="talkingdogs__content">
            And then there are the completely unexpected ideas that may pop-up
            when you ask for nonsense. Like the project with
            <a class="talkingdogs__link">the invisible animations I did with Hannes Wallrafen.</a
            ><a class="talkingdogs__link" href="#fn-8" id="fnref-8" title="see footnote" class="footnote"
              ><sup>8</sup></a
            >
            When I asked Hannes if he had some ideas that were too ridiculous to
            suggest, he told me he wanted funny little animations on his
            website, even though he is blind. Animated illustrations aren’t very
            weird, and even coming up with a textual alternative is something
            we&#8217;ve done before. But by designing the animations first for
            Hannes, and testing them first with him I came to new insights. In
            hindsight it’s almost too obvious, but it’s a very clever
            prototyping workflow to first test the textual alternative of an
            animation before you create the animation itself. Creating an
            animation is a lot of work, writing a small punchline is much easier
            to create, and much easier to iterate.

          <p class="talkingdogs__content">
            Another idea that came out of this project was the idea to make
            screen readers laugh. It was the first time Hannes heard some
            emotion from his screen reader. It made me realise that even within
            the tight constraints of a screen reader, which sounds neutral and
            maybe even boring by design, we are able to add some emotion to our
            design.
          </p>

          <p class="talkingdogs__content">
            This idea of making screen readers laugh resulted in the open
            database of strings that make different voices of different screen
            readers laugh. This database is funny, sure, but it is also a first
            step in trying to lift screen reader interaction beyond what Graham

            Of course there are serious reasons for allowing nonsense into your
            design process. But for me the most important reason for using
            nonsense, and not some other ideation method, is to allow
            <em class="fun__strong">fun</em> into the design process. Designing accessibility,
            helping disabled people lead an independent life is serious work.
            But it can be fun as well. And only if we allow fun will we be able
            to start making pleasurable user interfaces. If we do, maybe some
            day in the future Léonie Watson will come over to my university
            again, and this time she will be able to explain what makes an
            interface fun to use for someone who is blind.
            And so, by writing about nonsense, we've reached the end of this
            thesis.
